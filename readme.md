## FEM-Heavy DTU course
Building a Finite element program. 

Group partner: Laura Stokbro 

We were provided with a standard program to begin with. Every week the program was developed further to solve various problems: truss, continuum, non-linear, dynamic, plate theory, topology optimization. 

Week 1-5 developing a Matlab program
